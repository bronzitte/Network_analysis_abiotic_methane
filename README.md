## 1. Jupyter notebooks used for data processing and analysis in the paper.

Codes and comments can be seen in the notebooks. Tutorials for setting up jupyter notebooks could be found here:https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/
- Data-processing-final.ipynb (*clean up the dataset*)
- Network-reduced-normalized-final.ipynb (*run major analysis*) 
- Network-reduced-normalized-sensitivity.ipynb (*run sensitivity analysis on removing edges of the network*)

## 2. Spreadsheet files
- dataset.xlsx (*the original dataset used for analysis)
All other excel files are intermediate datasets generated during data processing and analysis

## 3. Figures
All png and svg files are generated figures during analysis. Many figures in the paper are adjusted in inkscape software based on these files.
